    <h1> You Rock my world</h1>
    <h4>Michael Jackson</h4>

    <pre>
        [Intro: Chris Tucker & Michael Jackson]
Oh man! Look at that girl right there!
Goodness gracious! Uh! That girl's fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine! She know she fine, too!
She is banging!
She's off the hook!
She looks good, you're right
Ahh-uh-uh-uh-uh, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl
Chris, I can get her
You can't get that girl, Mike
I guarantee you can't get that girl!
Watch me get that girl
